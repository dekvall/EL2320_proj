## SLAM with hough transfrom

Runs on videos with 5 fps
Uses mainly the corridor video

### SLAM Approach

Landmarks determined by houghspace coordinates. 

If we move forwards in a straight line no change will be made in the hough space for the 

The density in a houghspace bucket determines how long the line is. 

COMPLICATED AF.

Leaning towards the mapping approach


### Mapping approach??

1. Expect uniform motion

2. Make a 2(or 3) dimensional map of the 3d space

Lines will be laid out on a 3d grid.
